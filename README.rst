Kala: Project Management in Django
**********************************

Kala is a project management application written in Python on the Django web framework. The intent is for the Kala to
act as a drop in replacement for Basecamp. Kala can import your projects and files from an existing Basecamp
installation. As of the writing of this document, Kala only supports files and file versions, although adding additional
components should relatively straight forward.

Basecamp is a registered trademark of 37signals, LLC and Kala has no affiliation with either.

Kala is the Hawaiian name for surgeonfish and is the mascot for the Kala project management software.

============
Installation
============

Kala was written for Django 1.5, an earlier version **MAY** work but has **NOT** been tested, so your on your own if you
need to use an earlier version. Kala was developed on Python 2.7, if you would like to help port to Python 3 that would
be great. Kala was also written on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and uses Postgres 9.1 as the database. While it is absolutely not a
requirement to use this setup, it will probably be the easiest to get running.

I also deploy using nginx and uwsgi, and the installation instructions reflect this choice. There are many different
ways of deploying Django projects, including Apache and Gunicorn. If you are not well versed in Django deployment then
the following will work fine, just be aware that you can deploy in a different way.


--------------
Ubuntu Install
--------------

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Install the required packages
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo aptitude install git gcc python python-dev nginx-full postfix postgresql-9.1 postgresql-server-dev-9.1 \
    uwsgi uwsgi-plugin-python

If you are planning on using the import features you should install rabbitmq as well.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo aptitude install rabbitmq-server

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Clone the Kala git repository from github.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/bgroff/kala.git

+++++++++++++++++++++
Create the virtualenv
+++++++++++++++++++++

I like to place this inside the project folder, but this is not a requirement.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv .venv

+++++++++++
Pip install
+++++++++++

Then you can install all of the required packages in the requirements.txt file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

+++++++++++++++
Create Database
+++++++++++++++

To create a new database, you can su into the postgres user account, create a new user, then a new database. Once you
have done this, exit out of the postgres shell and sync the database tables. You will need to edit your database
settings to reflect the usernames and passwords you have chosen.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo su - postgres
    $ createuser -l -P kala
    $ createdb -O kala kala
    $ exit
    $ python manage.py syncdb

+++++++++++++++++
Configure Servers
+++++++++++++++++

The last step is to configure uwsgi and nginx. Start by creating the file /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/kala.ini with the
following (edit to meet your needs):

.. code-block:: bash

    [uwsgi]
    vhost = true
    plugins = python
    master = true
    enable-threads = true
    processes = 2
    chdir = /home/username/kala
    module = kala.wsgi:application
    env = DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=kala.settings
    virtualenv = /home/username/kala/.venv
    touch-reload = /home/username/kala/.venv/reload

Then create a symlink in the app-enabled directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo ln -s /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/kala.ini /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/kala.ini

Then create the file /etc/nginx/sites-available/kala (you may need to remove any default sites). Also make sure that
the static media directory and the documents directory can be read by www-data and that media can be written to and read
by www-data.

If you need files larger than 200M adjust the client_max_body_size.

.. code-block:: bash

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name kala.yourdomain.com;
        access_log /var/log/nginx/kala.yourdomain.com.access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/kala.yourdomain.com.error.log;
        client_max_body_size 200M;

        location / {
            uwsgi_pass unix:/run/uwsgi/app/kala/socket;
            include    uwsgi_params;
        }

        location /media/ {
            alias /home/username/kala/kala/media/;
        }

        location /static/ {
            alias /home/username/kala/kala/static/;
        }
    }

Finally link that file to the sites-enabled and restart both uwsgi and nginx:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/kala /etc/nginx/sites-available/kala
    $ sudo service uwsgi restart && sudo service nginx restart

That should be it, save for the celery & rabbitmq which will be described later. Load up the webpage with your browser.
I failed to mention the postfix configuration as this is outside the scope of this document. There are some good
tutorials out there though, so go googling.
